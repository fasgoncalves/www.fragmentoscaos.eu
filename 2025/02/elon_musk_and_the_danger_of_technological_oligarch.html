<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Rise of an Unchecked Tycoon</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elon Musk is no longer just a visionary entrepreneur. Over the past few years, he has become a figure with <strong>disproportionate power over strategic sectors of the U.S.</strong>, from space exploration to military communications. His influence extends to defense, artificial intelligence, and even public opinion through his ownership of X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most alarming aspect of this rise is that it is happening <strong>without any effective regulation</strong> from the U.S. administration or Congress. This raises a crucial question: <strong>Is Musk building a parallel empire, with more power than the U.S. government itself?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Concentration of Power in Musk’s Hands</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Musk controls an impressive array of critical infrastructures and technologies essential to national security:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Starlink (SpaceX):</strong> A global satellite network that has become vital for military operations, communications, and intelligence. Musk has already <strong>intervened directly in its use</strong>, refusing to allow Ukraine to use the service to attack Russian targets, citing concerns about escalating the conflict.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>SpaceX:</strong> The main provider of launches for NASA and the Pentagon. Without SpaceX’s rockets, the U.S. would lose much of its ability to deploy military satellites and strategic missions.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Tesla and AI:</strong> The company leads in autonomous vehicle development and artificial intelligence—technologies with direct implications for mobility and security.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>X/Twitter:</strong> The most influential social network in global political discourse, which has been used to amplify <strong>far-right narratives and misinformation</strong>, while weakening content moderation policies.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This level of power concentration in a single individual is <strong>unprecedented in modern U.S. history</strong> and poses a <strong>direct threat to the country’s democratic principles</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Complicit Silence of the Government and Congress</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most shocking aspect is not Musk’s growing empire but the <strong>passivity of the U.S. administration and Senate</strong> in addressing his unchecked power. Several factors explain this inaction:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Lack of regulation</strong> – The U.S. government has never established effective laws to regulate the influence of big tech in critical sectors.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Dependence on Musk’s technology</strong> – The <strong>Pentagon and NASA rely heavily on SpaceX</strong> for strategic missions, making criticism risky.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Powerful lobbying</strong> – Like other major tech companies, Musk invests millions in political influence to <strong>avoid restrictions on his power</strong>.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Political division</strong> – While <strong>Trump and Republicans</strong> see him as an ally in the fight against the "system," <strong>Democrats hesitate to confront him directly</strong>.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The consequence of this passivity is clear: <strong>a private entrepreneur is accumulating a level of power comparable to that of a state, without being subject to any democratic checks.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Dystopian Future?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Musk continues on this trajectory, the U.S. risks becoming <strong>hostage to a technological oligarchy</strong>, where fundamental decisions for the country will be in the hands of billionaires with no obligation to answer to the public or the government.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, Musk already <strong>interferes in international conflicts and controls essential infrastructures</strong>. Tomorrow, his influence on elections, defense, and global geopolitics could be even greater.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the U.S. administration does not act swiftly to <strong>regulate and limit this unchecked power</strong>, the <strong>science fiction scenario of a country ruled by a tech elite could soon become an irreversible reality.</strong></p>
